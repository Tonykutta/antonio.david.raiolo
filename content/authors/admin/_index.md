I am a master student pursing my degree in Process Engineering at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. Currently I am working on my master thesis titled "Phase-field simulation of crystal anisotropy and sintering using an FEM-based framework". My interest in nanoparticle reseach motivated the selection of this topic. This study explores the effect of grain boundary energy anisotropy and surface energy anisotropy on the evolution of particle sintering.
