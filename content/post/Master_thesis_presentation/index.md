Sintering of nanoparticles can be simulated using phase field methods. A comprehensive model to study spherical particles sintering including advection fluxes, grain boundary energy anisotropy on multiple particles has been implemented. A coupling of rigid body motion (rotation) with grain boundary energy anisotropy has been achieved, through an angle update.
Furthermore, surface energy anisotropy leading to faceting of particles is being studied. The presentation also shows the sintering of non-spherical particles.  More simulations of non-spherical particles are currently in progress.
